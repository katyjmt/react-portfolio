          Hi, I&apos;m Katy! I&apos;ve been working in the tech industry for 7
          years, over which time I&apos;ve worn multiple hats as project
          manager, front-end developer, UX consultant, designer, strategist,
          data analyst and account manager.
          <br />
          <br />
          I love creating beautiful and useful things, and get deep satisfaction
          out of working out how to do something from first principles. Over the
          years I&apos;ve done self-driven deep-dives into front-end coding,
          SQL, typeface design, book binding, sewing and pattern making, how to
          fit-out a camper van, and lots of other creative and analytical
          pursuits. I&apos;m currently completing a full-stack coding bootcamp.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over my professional life, I&apos;ve collaborated closely with
          talented teams of developers and designers on website and microsite
          projects for renowned brands like Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Bega,
          Mars, Fitness First, Warner Music, and more. The projects I&apos;ve
          worked on, and the people I&apos;ve worked with have taught me a lot
          about what good design is. How to create something that&apos;s not
          just aesthetically delightful, but that is designed around a deep
          understanding of the user and their needs.
          <br />
          <br />
          This website is a place for me to document my personal projects and
          explorations. Thanks for visiting!
